# Tech to-do
- Create product page
  - Add platform information
- For shop assets: generate a random unique string as path to keep images hidden
- Create product details page
- Update Dashboard main navigation
  - Change side menu to fixed like Deliverr?
  - Add breadcrumbs for current active page
- Add option for inactive products
  - Allow importing of inactive Lazada products
- Backend API should return error_code, this code will be used for i18n on the frontend. The backend can
  also return a human readable message in the requested locale.

# Thoughts
It seems for SKU creation, the best approach is to create a logical data model for the service. This data model will then be the source of truth from which we create translation functions for each individual platform. The tricky thing will be that it seems Lazada has predefined SKU attributes. They do not allow arbitrary SKU creation. It seems Tiki also follows this strategy.

# Image notes

There is no commerce API available yet for Vietnam. However, for the business manager API, we can create product catalogues it seems.
