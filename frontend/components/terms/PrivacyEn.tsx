      <h3 className="text font-medium">Information You Provide to Us</h3>

      <p>
        We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, you
        share information directly with us when you create an account, fill out
        a form, submit or post content through our Services, purchase a
        membership, communicate with us via third-party platforms, request

        We do not collect payment information through our Services. We rely on
        third parties to process payments in connection with our Services. Any
        information you provide to facilitate such a payment is subject to the
        third-party payment processor&apos;s privacy policy, and we encourage
        you to review this policy before you provide any information to the
        payment processor.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text font-medium">
        Information We Collect Automatically When You Interact with Us
      </h3>
      <p>
        In some instances, we automatically collect certain information,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-inside list-disc space-y-4">
        <li>
          Activity Information: We collect information about your activity on
          our Services, such as your product information history.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transactional Information: When you purchase our service, we collect
          information about the transaction, such as subscription details,

        </li>
        <li>
          Device and Usage Information: We collect information about how you
          access our Services, including data about the device and network you
          use, such as your hardware model, operating system version, mobile
          network, IP address, unique device identifiers, browser type, and app
          version. We also collect information about your activity on our
          Services, such as access times, pages viewed, links clicked, and the

        </li>
        <li>
          Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies: We
          use tracking technologies, such as cookies and web beacons, to collect
          information about you. Cookies are small data files stored on your
          hard drive or in device memory that help us improve our Services and
          your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are
          popular, and count visits. Web beacons (also known as &quot;pixel
          tags&quot; or &quot;clear GIFs&quot;) are electronic images that we
          use on our Services and in our emails to help deliver cookies, count
          visits, and understand usage. We also work with third party analytics
          providers who use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers, and other
          technologies to collect information about your use of our Services and
          other websites and applications, including your IP address, web
          browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages
          or in mobile apps, and links clicked. This information may be used by
          Laxo and others to, among other things, analyze and track data,
          determine the popularity of certain content, deliver content targeted
          to your interests on our Services, and better understand your online
          activity.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text font-medium">
        Information We Collect from Other Sources
      </h3>
      <p>
        We obtain information from third-party sources. For example, we may
        collect information about you from social networks, accounting services
        providers and data analytics providers. Additionally, if you create or
        log into your Laxo account through a third-party platform (such as
        Apple, Facebook, TikTok, or Lazada), we will have access to certain
        information from that platform, such as your name, lists of friends or
        followers, birthday, and profile picture, in accordance with the
        authorization procedures determined by such platform.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text font-medium">Information We Derive</h3>
      <p>
        We may derive information or draw inferences about you based on the
        information we collect. For example, we may make inferences about your
        location based on your IP address or infer reading preferences based on
        your reading history.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-medium">SHARING OF INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>
        We share personal information in the following circumstances or as
        otherwise described in this policy:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-inside list-disc space-y-4">
        <li>
          We share personal information with vendors, service providers, and
          consultants that need access to personal information in order to
          perform services for us, such as companies that assist us with web
          hosting, storage, and other infrastructure, analytics, payment
          processing, fraud prevention and security, customer service,
          communications, and marketing.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may disclose personal information if we believe that disclosure is
          in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law or legal
          process, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet
          national security or law enforcement requirements. If we are going to
          disclose your personal information in response to legal process, we
          will give you notice so you can challenge it (for example by seeking
          court intervention), unless we are prohibited by law or believe doing
          so may endanger others or cause illegal conduct. We will object to
          legal requests for information about users of our Services that we
          believe are improper.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may share personal information if we believe that your actions are
          inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, if we believe that
          you have violated the law, or if we believe it is necessary to protect
          the rights, property, and safety of Laxo, our users, the public, or
          others.
        </li>
        <li>
          We share personal information with our lawyers and other professional
          advisors where necessary to obtain advice or otherwise protect and
          manage our business interests.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may share personal information in connection with, or during
          negotiations concerning, any merger, sale of company assets,
          financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by
          another company.
        </li>
        <li>
          Personal information is shared between and among Laxo and our current
          and future parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries and other companies
          under common control and ownership.
        </li>
        <li>
          We share personal information with your consent or at your direction.
        </li>
        <li>
          We also share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot
          reasonably be used to identify you.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-lg font-medium">THIRD-PARTY EMBEDS</h2>
      <p>
        Laxo does not host some of the content displayed on our Services. Users
        have the ability to post content that is actually hosted by a third
        party, but is embedded in our pages (an &quot;Embed&quot;). When you
        interact with an Embed, it can send information about your interaction
        to the hosting third party just as if you were visiting the third
        party&apos;s site directly. For example, when you load a product page
        with a Lazada video Embed and watch the video, Lazada receives
        information about your activity, such as your IP address and how much of
        the video you watch. Laxo does not control what information third
        parties collect through Embeds or what they do with the information.
        This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through
        Embeds. The privacy policy belonging to the third party hosting the
        Embed applies to any information the Embed collects, and we recommend
        you review that policy before interacting with the Embed.
      </p>
